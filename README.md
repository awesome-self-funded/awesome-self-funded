# Awesome Self Funded

An inspirational list of successful **self-funded AKA "bootstrapped"** software startups that never took any outside funding, but turn a profit instead.

Awesome products that have significant annual revenue of 7-figures or close, and where a paying customer is the only boss they have to please (not VC or the owning megacorp).

PS. While compiling this list I found many, many companies who used to be self-funded and very profitable, but eventually decided to raise a round. SurveyMonkey, GitHub, Braintree, Shopify, ConvertKit - all had tens of millions in revenue when eventually taking the VC road.
